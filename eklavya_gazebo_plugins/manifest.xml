    <description brief="eklavya_gazebo_plugins">
        Contains a differential drive plugin that works with the eklavya robot model provided
        in the eklavya_description package. The plugin may also work for other differential drive 
        robots. The purpose of this custom plugin is to build the ROS functionality directly into a 
        proper Gazebo plugin, rather than a node that communicates with Gazebo.
